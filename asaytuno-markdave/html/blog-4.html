            <p>My keyboard keys were starting to feel sticky and the dust was visible under the backlight. It was distracting while I was trying to code, so I decided to do a deep clean.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Procedure:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Took a photo of the keyboard layout for reference.</li>
                <li>Removed all keycaps using a puller.</li>
                <li>Used compressed air to blow out the crumbs and thick dust.</li>
                <li>Cleaned the plate using a small brush and isopropyl alcohol.</li>
                <li>Soaked the keycaps in soapy water and dried them.</li>
                <li>Reassembled the keys.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The keyboard feels much smoother now and looks brand new. It was a simple task but it made my setup much cleaner.</p>

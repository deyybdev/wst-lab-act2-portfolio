            <p>I don’t commit code every day. Sometimes I’m stuck debugging. Sometimes I feel unmotivated. But whenever I do commit, it means one thing, it means progress.</p>
            
            <p>In programming, if you don’t commit, your work isn’t saved. You can spend hours coding, but without committing, it can disappear. It’s like it never happened. Life feels the same.</p>
            
            <p>We all have plans to finish our degree, to make our family proud, to build something meaningful. But sometimes we just think about them. We don’t fully commit.</p>
            
            <blockquote>
                “Commit to the Lord whatever you do, and He will establish your plans.” — Proverbs 16:3
            </blockquote>
            
            <p>As a student with big dreams, I’ve learned that commitment isn’t about being perfect. It’s about deciding that your dream matters. Just like in coding, I can’t control every error. But I can commit. I can take small steps. I can trust the process.</p>
            
            <p>Maybe I don’t commit code every day. But I want to commit my plans every day. Because uncommitted dreams stay unfinished.</p>

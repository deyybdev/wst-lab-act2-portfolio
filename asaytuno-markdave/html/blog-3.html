        <article class="article-body">
            <p>I recently faced a PC that refused to boot. Every time we hit the power button, the screen mocked us with a "No Bootable Device" error. The client was worried they had a dead hard drive or a fried motherboard.</p>
            
            <p>The machine cost 30,000 pesos, but the culprit turned out to be a tiny, 10-peso <strong>CMOS battery</strong>.</p>
            
            <p>Because that little silver coin was dead, the BIOS couldn't save its configuration. Every time the PC lost power, it reset to UEFI settings by default. The problem? The OS was installed in Legacy mode. No saved settings means no boot.</p>
            
            
            
            <p>It’s a technician’s classic "plot twist." We often look for the big system failures—the "missiles"—when the real issue is just a tiny, overlooked detail that keeps the system from remembering who it is.</p>

            <blockquote>
                "If you don't save the small settings, you'll never boot the big dreams."
            </blockquote>

            <p>As an IT student and technician, this repair served as a reminder: respect the fundamentals. Whether it's a single line of code or a small CR2032 battery, the system is only as strong as its smallest component. Don't ignore the CMOS in your life.</p>

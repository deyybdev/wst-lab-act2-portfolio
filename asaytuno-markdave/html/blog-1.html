        <article class="article-body">
            <p>I was watching a TikTok live where people were talking about IT students and innovation. They said that as future IT professionals, we should create valuable inventions. Systems that can help people and make a difference.</p>
            
            <p>Then one guy suddenly said:</p>
            
            <blockquote>“Pwede ka gumawa ng system na makakatulong sa ibang bansa, pag gawa ng missile, 'di ba?”</blockquote>
            
            <p>I laughed. A missile? Why would an IT student make a missile? But it made me think. Maybe what he meant was that we should create something powerful. Something impactful. Something that can really change things.</p>
            
            <p>As an IT student, I don't want to build weapons. I want to build systems that help people. Maybe a system for disaster response. Maybe a website for small businesses. Maybe an app that makes daily tasks easier.</p>
            
            <p>We don't need to create something explosive to make an impact. Sometimes, a simple system that works properly is already powerful.</p>
            
            <p>So no, I won't make a missile. But I will build something meaningful. And maybe that's more powerful than a missile.</p>

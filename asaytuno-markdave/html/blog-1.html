        <article class="article-body">
            <p>Today I saw a TikTok video of a live stream where people were talking about IT students and innovation. They were saying that as future IT professionals, we should focus on creating valuable inventions and systems that can actually help people and make a difference in the world.</p>
            
            <p>While I was listening, one guy suddenly commented:</p>
            
            <blockquote>“Pwede ka gumawa ng system na makakatulong sa ibang bansa, like pag gawa ng missile, 'di ba?”</blockquote>
            
            <p>I laughed at first. A missile? Why would an IT student like me build a weapon? But it really made me think. Maybe what he meant was that we should aim for something powerful and impactful, something that truly changes things.</p>
            
            <p>As an IT student, I don't want to build weapons. I want to build systems that solve real problems. Maybe a system for disaster response, a website for small businesses, or an app that makes daily tasks easier for everyone.</p>
            
            <p>We don't need to create something explosive to make an impact. Sometimes, a simple, reliable system that works properly is already powerful enough.</p>
            
            <p>So no, I won't make a missile. But I will build something meaningful. And to me, that is more powerful than any weapon.</p>

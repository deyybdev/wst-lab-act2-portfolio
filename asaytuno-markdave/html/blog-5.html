            <p>Today, Feb 25, marks the anniversary of the EDSA People Power Revolution. As a student, I think it is important to look back and understand what this day means for our country.</p>
            
            <p>For me, EDSA is a symbol of unity. It showed the world that Filipinos are capable of standing together for a common goal. It reminds us that our voices matter and that we have the power to shape our future.</p>
            
            <blockquote>"The importance of EDSA is not just in the past; it is an inspiration for us today to be brave and to love our country."</blockquote>

            <p>We should never forget the lessons of history. It serves as a reminder to be responsible citizens and to always choose what is good for the Philippines. Being brave doesn't always require big actions—sometimes, it's just about doing the right thing in our daily lives.</p>
            
            <p>Let’s keep the spirit of love for our country alive.</p>
